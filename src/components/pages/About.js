      <p>
      Front-end Web Developer with strong math skills and a degree in Material Engineering. Recognized as proactive, resourceful, and persistent problem-solver. Iâ€™m looking to leverage my development skills to provide small businesses with web applications that support their metrics. I earned a certificate as a full-stack developer from the University of Toronto where I implemented JavaScript, Node, SQL, HTML, and CSS. 

I recently collaborated on developing a webpage with an agile development approach that featured a log-in/log-out interface. All the webpages were deployed in Github and the second one was also deployed in Heroku.  I have also created an app using object-oriented programming which is a very unique aspect of JavaScript. It is my technical acumen combined with strong leadership and collaborative skills that make me an advantageous candidate for any team.
